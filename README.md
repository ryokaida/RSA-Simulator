# RSA-Simulator
Small Python Program to simulate the RSA algorithm with key generation, encryption, and decryption.
Made for a project in a class.
The executable (.exe) file is in the dist folder!

To use:
Select y/n to simulate or not.
Enter the values for m, p, q, and e.
The program will calculate the public and private keys.
It will then encrypt and decrypt your plaintext message (m).
After decrypting, the program will print whether the decryption was sucessful or not.
To quit, when prompted whether to simulate again, press n and then press q.
